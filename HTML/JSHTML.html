    <h1>Java Script home work</h1>
    
    <h3>1. <u>What is the difference between 'var' and 'let'?</u> </h3>
    <p>Both are Java Script keyword;  <b>'var'</b> is used in Java Script since 1995 but <b>'let'</b> was added to Java Script in 2015. <br>
    Unlike <b>'var'</b>, <b>'let'</b> can't be redeclared, must be declared before use and have a block scope. </p>
    
    <h3>2. <u>Java Script arithmetic:</u></h3>
    <p>((1/6)*(3/2))/((4/3)+(1/2)) = ?</p>
    <b><p id="result"></p></b>

    <script>
        let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
        x = ((a / 6) * (c / b)) / ((4 / c) + (a / b))
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "the answer is =" + " " +  x; 

    </script>
